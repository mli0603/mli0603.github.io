        About me
    </h2>
    <div>
        I am a Research Scientist at NVIDIA's <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/">Deep
            Imagination Research</a> group. I am broadly interested in 3D reconstruction, generation,
        robotics, and embodied systems, all of
        which are connected to the concept of spatial intelligence.
        I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University on visual servoing for surgical robotics,
        advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/russell-taylor/">Dr.
            Russell H Taylor</a> and
        co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/mathias-unberath/">Dr. Mathias
            Unberath</a>.
        I received my Bachelor degree from University of British Columbia, advised by <a
            href="https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/">Dr. Tim Salcudean</a>.
        I have been fortunate to collaborate with many brilliant minds at NVIDIA, Meta Reality Labs,
        Intuitive, UBC and JHU.
