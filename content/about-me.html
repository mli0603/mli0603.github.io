        advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/russell-taylor/">Dr.
            Russell H Taylor</a> and
        co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/mathias-unberath/">Dr. Mathias
            Unberath</a>.
        I received my Bachelor degree from University of British Columbia, advised by <a
            href="https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/">Dr. Tim Salcudean</a>.
