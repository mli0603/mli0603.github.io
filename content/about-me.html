        About me
    </h2>
    <div>
        I am a Research Scientist at NVIDIA's <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/">Deep
            Imagination Research</a> group. I am interested in spatial intelligence &mdash; enabling AI to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world.
        My research has been integrated into several products for NVIDIA, including <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/">NVIDIA Cosmos</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/edify/">NVIDIA Edify</a>.
        My research has been awarded the TIME's Best Inventions of 2023 and the Best AI and Best Overall at CES 2025.
        <!-- I have published across top-tier venues in computer vision, graphics, robotics, and healthcare, including CVPR, ICCV, SIGGRAPH, IROS, ICRA, MICCAI, IPCAI and ICLR. -->
        I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University,
        advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/russell-taylor/">Dr.
            Russell H Taylor</a> and
        co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/mathias-unberath/">Dr. Mathias
            Unberath</a>.
        I received my Bachelor degree from University of British Columbia, advised by <a
            href="https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/">Dr. Tim Salcudean</a>.
        I have been fortunate to collaborate with many brilliant minds at NVIDIA, Meta Reality Labs,
        Intuitive, UBC and JHU.
